# Credit Approval

The purpose of this project is to develop a classification model to predict if prospective clients will repay their debt based on their profile and payment history. The model would function by taking a set of the borrowerâ€™s features as inputs and predicting whether the loan will be repaid or not as an output.

The data set chosen for this project was the Credit Card Approval Prediction, from the public data source Kaggle and can be downloaded in the following URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rikdifos/credit-card-approval-prediction/download?datasetVersionNumber=3
